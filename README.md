# Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided : 

- **Focus on High-Ticket Items**: Continue promoting and expanding the desktop PC and LCD HDTV product lines, as they are significant profit drivers. Introducing new models or features tailored to consumer preferences can sustain growth in these segments.

- **Enhance Marketing for Low-Ticket Items**: Invest in targeted marketing strategies to boost sales in low-ticket categories like games and toys. This could involve promotional campaigns, bundling products, or seasonal discounts to attract customers and increase sales volume.

- **Leverage Customer Loyalty**: With a strong repeat customer rate of 53.40%, implement loyalty programs that reward returning customers. This could increase repeat purchases and enhance customer engagement, ultimately boosting profitability.

- **Geographic Market Expansion**: Explore opportunities to strengthen the presence in lower-performing markets, particularly in France. Tailoring marketing strategies to local preferences and considering partnerships can enhance brand visibility and sales.

- **Invest in Customer Retention Strategies**: Given the significant decline in retention rates post-2019, develop engagement strategies such as personalized email campaigns and exclusive offers to enhance customer loyalty and retention.
